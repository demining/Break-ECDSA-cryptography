# CryptoDeepTools
Crypto Deep Tools a set of scripts for detailed cryptanalysis of the Blockchain network in cryptocurrency Bitcoin 

---

## Analyze the data from the file "RawTX.json" (which we received in [01BlockchainGoogleDrive](https://github.com/demining/CryptoDeepTools/tree/main/01BlockchainGoogleDrive))


Script [breakECDSA.py](https://github.com/demining/CryptoDeepTools/blob/main/02BreakECDSAcryptography/breakECDSA.py) reconstructs the signed message for each to find the Z value. The result is returned as R, S, Z, PUBKEY for each of the inputs present in the data in the "RawTX.json" file.
